PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE 

Research Intern, Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS), St. George’s, Bermuda               June 2022-July 2022 
• Iteratively modified $13,000 autonomous surface vessel (ASV) and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system to 
accurately collect bathymetric data (sonar and RGB imaging) and perform autonomous surveying missions in 
turbulent >19kmph currents, over six-week period. 
• Planned and facilitated, alongside BIOS’ Department of Education, a week-long camp for Mid-Atlantic Robots IN 
Education Program, to teach 10 high school students A) the importance of marine exploration technology and B) how 
to operate such devices.  
• Dissected 2000+ images in Agisoft Metashape, collected from ASV imaging, to create multiple 3D orthographic maps 
of 20m-by-20m region of 12A marker coral reef; suited for identifying marine coral species and bathymetric data. 
• Directed an engagement with 20+ marine biologists, educators, and interns on the advantageous research results of 
synergistic ASV and AUV system on marine exploration.  
• Recipient of the BIOS Graint-in-Aid 
• R. Staggers Jr., A. Adith, Y. Shethwala, and J. Das, "An Autonomous Surface Vessel for Persistent Mapping and 
Monitoring of Coral Reef Ecosystems" unpublished
