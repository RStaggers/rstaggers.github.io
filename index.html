<h2>Professional Experience</h2> 
<h3>Research Intern, Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS), St. George’s, Bermuda (June 2022-July 2022) </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Iteratively modified $13,000 autonomous surface vessel (ASV) and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system to 
accurately collect bathymetric data (sonar and RGB imaging) and perform autonomous surveying missions in 
turbulent >19kmph currents, over six-week period. </li>
  <li>Planned and facilitated, alongside BIOS’ Department of Education, a week-long camp for Mid-Atlantic Robots IN 
Education Program, to teach 10 high school students A) the importance of marine exploration technology and B) how 
to operate such devices.</li>
  <li>Dissected 2000+ images in Agisoft Metashape, collected from ASV imaging, to create multiple 3D orthographic maps 
of 20m-by-20m region of 12A marker coral reef; suited for identifying marine coral species and bathymetric data.</li>
<li>Directed an engagement with 20+ marine biologists, educators, and interns on the advantageous research results of 
  synergistic ASV and AUV system on marine exploration.</li>
  <li>Recipient of the BIOS Graint-in-Aid</li>
</ul>

<h3>Research Aide (Pro Bono), Arizona State University’s Center for Global Discovery and Conservation Science, Tempe, AZ, USA (Aug. 2021-Present)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Spearheaded 2-member collaboration to design and build an autonomous tethered system of two to three rovers 
  with the purpose of examining bio-geographical aspects of cliffs. </li>
<li>Incorporated Python code into the Robot Operating System (ROS) to control rovers’ trajectory via its Inertial 
  Measurement Unit (IMU) and RC transmitter. </li> 
<li>Managed two Graduate students on the design of ASV and AUV to map coral reefs in local and international testbed 
  sites</li>
</ul>

<h3>Undergraduate research assistant (student worker IV), Arizona State University’s School of Earth and Space Exploration, Tempe, AZ, USA (June 2021-Aug. 2021)</h3>  
<ul>
<li>Developed C++ code to receive depth of 4.4kg-aquatic multi-probe sonde and control motor's power to achieve 
specified incremental depths, to explore 5-meter-deep lake. </li>
<li>Conducted 70 tests to create a proportional controller to minimize variation of published instrument depth and actual 
depth to within 1 centimeter error. </li>
<li>Manufactured laser-cut and 3D-prints from CAD-generated models to mount sensors to self-constructed aluminum 
chassis on catamaran boat. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Space Grant Intern, ASU/NASA Space Grant Program, Tempe, AZ, USA  (Aug. 2019-April 2021)</h3> 
  <ul>
<li>Utilized CAD modeling to build hardware on autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) designed to map coral reefs at 
depths of 18m below seawater. </li>
<li>Applied Fluid Mechanics to A) create simulations of stress and strain of 3D-printed AUV components and B) to model 
AUV's equation of motion. </li>
<li>Engaged with team of three post-Doc students to mirror AUV's movement in ROS Gazebo. </li>
</ul>
 
<h2>Academic Projects</h2> 
<h3>Capstone Project: Air Diaphragm Engine (Jan. 2021-July 2021) </h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Ran ANSYS simulations to construct non-electrical RC air diaphragm engine on $500 budget.  </li>
<li>Evaluated computational analyses to foresee if design could survive intake of 30-70psi in ANSYS.  </li>
Implemented usage of PLA and elaborate rubber sheets in later iterations of planned design. </li>
  </ul>

<h3>ASU EPICS/Bridge2Africa: Community Partner Liaison  (Jan. 2019-May 2020)  </h3>
<ul>
<li>Designed prototype frame in SOLIDWORKS for wheelchair that could traverse inclined/jagged surfaces  </li>
<li>Served as Liaison between group and its South-African Community Partner on biweekly basis </li>
<li>Performed Design Reviews to document data compilation to engineering professional</li>
</ul>
