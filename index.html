<h1>PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE</h1> 

<h2>Research Intern, Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS), St. George’s, Bermuda (June 2022-July 2022) </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Iteratively modified $13,000 autonomous surface vessel (ASV) and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) system to 
accurately collect bathymetric data (sonar and RGB imaging) and perform autonomous surveying missions in 
turbulent >19kmph currents, over six-week period. </li>
  <li>Planned and facilitated, alongside BIOS’ Department of Education, a week-long camp for Mid-Atlantic Robots IN 
Education Program, to teach 10 high school students A) the importance of marine exploration technology and B) how 
to operate such devices.</li>
  <li>Dissected 2000+ images in Agisoft Metashape, collected from ASV imaging, to create multiple 3D orthographic maps 
of 20m-by-20m region of 12A marker coral reef; suited for identifying marine coral species and bathymetric data.</li>
<li>Directed an engagement with 20+ marine biologists, educators, and interns on the advantageous research results of 
  synergistic ASV and AUV system on marine exploration.</li>
  <li>Recipient of the BIOS Graint-in-Aid</li>
